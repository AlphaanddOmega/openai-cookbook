    "# Reranking search results with cross-encoders\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes you through examples of using a cross-encoder to re-rank search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common use case with our customers, where you've implemented semantic search using embeddings (produced using a [Bi-encoder](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html#retrieval-bi-encoder)) but the results are not exactly what you need. A possible cause is that there is some business rule you can use to rerank the documents such as how recent or how popular a document is. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, often there are subtle domain-specific rules that help determine relevancy, and this is where a cross-encoder can be useful. Cross-encoders are more accurate than bi-encoders but they don't scale well, so using them to re-order a shortened list returned by semantic search is the ideal use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use text-davinci-003 with logprobs to build a cross-encoder here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook drew on this great [article](https://weaviate.io/blog/cross-encoders-as-reranker) by Weaviate, and this [excellent explanation](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html) of bi-encoders vs. cross-encoders from Sentence Transformers."

In this paper, we replace policy gradient with proximal policy optimization (PPO), which is a proved more efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, and propose a dynamic approach for PPO (PPO-dynamic). We demonstrate the efficacy of PPO and PPO-dynamic on conditional sequence generation tasks including synthetic experiment and chit-chat chatbot. The results show that PPO and PPO-dynamic can beat policy gradient by stability and performance.\n",

    "Retrieved document: Inside the bubble: exploring the environments of reionisation-era Lyman-α emitting galaxies with JADES and FRESCO: We present a study of the environments of 16 Lyman-α emitting galaxies (LAEs) in the reionisation era (5.8<z<8) identified by JWST/NIRSpec as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Unless situated in sufficiently (re)ionised regions, Lyman-α emission from these galaxies would be strongly absorbed by neutral gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We conservatively estimate sizes of the ionised regions required to reconcile the relatively low Lyman-α velocity offsets (ΔvLyα<300kms−1) with moderately high Lyman-α escape fractions (fesc,Lyα>5%) observed in our sample of LAEs, indicating the presence of ionised ``bubbles'' with physical sizes of the order of 0.1pMpc≲Rion≲1pMpc in a patchy reionisation scenario where the bubbles are embedded in a fully neutral IGM. Around half of the LAEs in our sample are found to coincide with large-scale galaxy overdensities seen in FRESCO at z∼5.8-5.9 and z∼7.3, suggesting Lyman-α transmission is strongly enhanced in such overdense regions, and underlining the importance of LAEs as tracers of the first large-scale ionised bubbles. Considering only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, we find our sample of UV-faint LAEs (MUV≳−20mag) and their direct neighbours are generally not able to produce the required ionised regions based on the Lyman-α transmission properties, suggesting lower-luminosity sources likely play an important role in carving out these bubbles. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST multi-object and slitless spectroscopy in acquiring a unique view of the early stages of Cosmic Reionisation via the most distant LAEs.\n",
